/*
  # Workspace members and sharing system

  1. New Tables
    - `workspace_members` - tracks shared access to workspaces
      - `id` (uuid, pk)
      - `workspace_id` (uuid, fk to workspaces)
      - `user_id` (uuid, fk to auth.users)
      - `role` (text: owner, editor, viewer)
      - `invited_by` (uuid, fk to auth.users)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)
    - Unique constraint on (workspace_id, user_id)

  2. Security
    - RLS enabled on workspace_members
    - Workspace owners and existing members can view membership
    - Only workspace owners can add or remove members
    - Members cannot escalate their own role

  3. Modified Tables
    - All existing table RLS policies updated to also allow
      workspace members (not just owners) to access data

  4. Important Notes
    - The workspace owner (workspaces.user_id) always has full access
    - Members get access based on their role
    - auto_share column added to workspaces to toggle workspace-wide sharing
