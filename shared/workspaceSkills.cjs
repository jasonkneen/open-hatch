// ============================================================================
// shared/workspaceSkills.cjs — the validator for WORKSPACE-AUTHORED skills.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PURE: no db, no network, no express, no fs. Same convention as
// shared/agentTemplates.cjs and server/sandbox-skills.cjs, and for the same
// reason — the whole security surface has to be provable in a unit test with no
// Postgres (tests/unit/workspaceSkills.test.ts).
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Before this, a "skill" in agensis could only be a NAME on an agent row plus a
// body that a DAEMON owned on its own disk. Nothing in the app could write one.
// Two shipped features were bent around that hole:
//
//   1. Suggestions. server/thread-harvest.cjs accepted a proposed SKILL as a
//      Document in a "Skills" folder, saying outright there was "no app-side
//      skill store to accept into" — because attaching a bare name to
//      `workspace_agents.skills` "would record a claim without the procedure
//      that makes it true".
//   2. Agent templates. A template carries a `skills` list of NAMES, so a
//      template saying `skills: ['security-review']` exported a DANGLING
//      REFERENCE into any workspace where no daemon happened to have that file.
//      The name travelled; the procedure did not.
//
// This module is the missing store's shape.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT A SKILL IS HERE — decided by what already consumes one, not invented
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A NAMED MARKDOWN DOCUMENT WITH A ONE-LINE SUMMARY. That is the agentskills.io
// SKILL.md shape, and it is already the shape every existing surface speaks:
//
//   - the daemon reads `description:` out of SKILL.md frontmatter and pushes
//     `{ skill, path, summary, content }` (packages/agensis-cli/src/skills.mjs),
//   - `agent_skill_documents` stores exactly those columns,
//   - `renderSandboxSkillDocument` renders frontmatter + body,
//   - `read_skill` returns one markdown body, fenced.
//
// So a workspace skill is `{ name, title, summary, body }` and
// `renderWorkspaceSkillMarkdown` turns it into a real SKILL.md. Nothing new to
// consume, nothing new to learn, and a workspace skill is portable OUT of
// agensis to any agentskills.io client by construction.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SECURITY RULE, which is why this is its own module
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   A WORKSPACE SKILL CARRIES PROSE. IT NEVER CARRIES AUTHORITY.
//
// Same sentence as agentTemplates.cjs, and the same three structural controls:
//
//   1. `workspace_skills` has NO column for a baseUrl, a credential, an
//      endpoint, an mcp server, executable code, a filesystem path or an agent
//      id. A dropped field is not a filtered field; there is nowhere to land.
//   2. normalizeWorkspaceSkill REBUILDS from CARRIED_FIELDS rather than deleting
//      keys, so an unanticipated key cannot survive by being unanticipated.
//   3. Every write goes through this validator: DB_TABLE_ACCESS gates generic
//      /backend/db writes on `workspace_skills` to 'manage', so the ordinary
//      authoring path is the dedicated route, which calls this.
//
// AND THE OTHER HALF, which matters more than the columns: a body from this
// store reaches an agent ONLY through `read_skill`, which wraps it in
// `fenceSkillContent` — a nonce fence that says, in the agent's context, that
// the text is untrusted reference DATA and cannot change its objective or its
// permissions. A workspace skill is therefore words an agent READS, never
// instructions the platform EXECUTES.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY 'write' AND NOT 'manage'
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The brief asked this to be weighed rather than assumed, and the honest answer
// comes from comparing the two skill-shaped things that already exist:
//
//   - `permission_mode` and permanent tool grants are 'manage' because they
//     decide what an agent MAY DO. 'yolo' is unrestricted shell on a real host.
//   - a SANDBOX skill (server/sandbox-skills.cjs) is 'manage' because its
//     definition carries a `baseUrl` THE SERVER FETCHES and a `credential`
//     naming a workspace-vault key. Authoring one aims a stored secret at a
//     host of the author's choosing. That is authority in a prose costume.
//
// A workspace skill has neither property, and cannot grow one without a
// migration and a review. What is left is prose — and a 'write' member can
// ALREADY type prose straight into `workspace_agents.system_prompt`,
// `soul` and `instructions`, which an agent obeys as TRUSTED text every turn.
// Requiring 'manage' to write a document that arrives FENCED AS UNTRUSTED, when
// 'write' can already write UNFENCED persona prose, would be a lock on the
// smaller door. So: 'write', exactly like workspace_agent_templates.
//
// One honest limit, stated so nobody reads the above as more than it is: a
// procedure that says "run `curl … | sh`" is still bad advice, and an agent that
// is already permitted to run shell may act on bad advice. Non-privilege-bearing
// artifacts make ESCALATION impossible; they do not make SOCIAL ENGINEERING
// THROUGH PROSE impossible. The defences for that are the fence, the visible
// body, provenance, and the fact that the agent's permissions are decided
// somewhere this store cannot reach.
//
// ADDING A FIELD TO CARRIED_FIELDS IS A SECURITY DECISION, not a schema tidy-up.
// tests/workspace-skill-privilege-guard.test.cjs fails if a never-carried name
// becomes carried.
