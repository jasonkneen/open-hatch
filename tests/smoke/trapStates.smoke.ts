// TRAP STATES: a stored preference must never be able to hide the control that
// clears it.
//
// This is the class the 2026-07-27 incident belongs to, and the reason it was
// invisible to every existing suite: each half was individually correct.
// `ownerFilter` persisted correctly. The Mine/All toggle rendered correctly
// under its condition. Only the COMBINATION — a stored 'mine' in a workspace
// whose agents were created by somebody else — filtered every agent away AND
// removed the only control that could undo it. Unrecoverable from the UI, and
// indistinguishable from data loss for the person holding it.
//
// So the assertion here is not "the toggle exists". It is RECOVERY: seed the
// stored preference that empties the surface, mount it, and require that either
// the filter yields, or some single control on screen brings the data back when
// clicked. Each control is tried on a fresh mount (see assertRecoverable), so
// nothing can recover by accident.
//
// ADDING A FILTER? The coverage guard at the bottom fails until the new
// preference is either in TRAPS or declared non-filtering with a reason.
