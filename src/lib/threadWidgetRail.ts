// Thread widget rail — the "is it open, and where does it sit?" decisions,
// deliberately free of React and the DOM so they can be tested directly.
//
// Three rules drive everything here.
//
// 1. **The rail shows itself, but a hand beats it.** A session's widgets appear
//    on their own the moment they have something to show (an agent posts a
//    to-do, a plan, a blocker) — an empty rail is just lost width. But once the
//    user has opened or closed it BY HAND for that session, their choice wins
//    forever after: a to-do arriving must not reopen a rail somebody closed and
//    yank the layout around mid-read.
//
// 2. **Opening the rail must not narrow the conversation.** The message column
//    is centred at `CHAT_COLUMN_MAX_WIDTH`; the rail is a fixed-width overlay
//    pinned to the right of the message surface. While the surface can hold
//    both side by side, the chat body reserves the rail's width and the column
//    keeps its full rendered width — it slides left, it does not shrink. Below
//    that the rail FLOATS OVER the messages rather than squeezing them into a
//    ribbon, and below `RAIL_MIN_SURFACE_WIDTH` it is not shown at all.
//
// 3. **The rail can hide; its control cannot.** Rule 1 makes the rail itself
//    conditional on content, and the toggle was briefly made conditional on the
//    same thing — which meant a session with no widgets showed no rail AND no
//    button, so nothing on screen said the feature existed. Since most sessions
//    have no items, most of the app looked like the feature had been deleted.
//    The toggle belongs to the SURFACE: if a session can have widgets, its
//    control is on screen, and pressing it opens the rail on its empty states.
//    An empty rail you asked for is a fine answer; no button at all is not.
//
// The previous layout did the opposite: every message row carried a 300px right
// padding while the rail was open, which cost the 800px column 220px of text
// width — code blocks gained a horizontal scrollbar and prose wrapped at half
// the window — even when there was empty gutter either side going spare.
