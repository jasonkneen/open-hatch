// Per-surface tips for the panel in the sidebar footer — the same space the
// "Get started" checklist occupies, reused once there is no onboarding left.
//
// Three rules this module exists to keep in one place:
//
//   1. THE CHECKLIST OUTRANKS TIPS. A half-finished setup step must never be
//      covered by advice about the canvas. `resolveGetStartedSlot` is the only
//      place that decides which of the two the space shows.
//   2. WHICH SURFACE IS A MAPPING, NOT A LOOKUP. This app is a windowed
//      desktop, so "the current page" is the focused window — a notion the app
//      already computes (top non-minimized window by zIndex). This module maps
//      that window's TYPE to a surface and nothing more, so there is no second
//      copy of the focus rule to drift.
//   3. EVERY CLAIM IS TRUE OF THE CODE. A tip that describes a feature the app
//      does not have is worse than no tip. Each one below was written against
//      the implementation, and the surrounding comments say where.
//
// Deliberately free of React so the whole thing is unit-testable.
