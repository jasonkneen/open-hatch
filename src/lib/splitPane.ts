// How a draggable divider decides where it is allowed to sit.
//
// Several windows in this app put a divider between two panes — browse lists,
// master/detail views, the Agents "Both" view and the Memory file browser — and
// every one of them remembers where it was left. That memory is the hazard: a
// split chosen in a 1400px-wide window and restored into a 700px one can leave a
// pane at zero size, showing nothing and saying nothing about why.
//
// So the stored number is NEVER the layout. It is a REQUEST, and this function
// is the answer, recomputed from the live container on every render. Nothing is
// written back, which is what makes the clamp reversible: shrink the window and
// the split tightens, grow it again and the size the user actually chose comes
// back.
//
// Pure and React-free on purpose — this is the part that has to be provable, and
// the drag plumbing that calls it lives in hooks/useSplitResize.ts.

/**
 * The size the primary pane gets, in px, from what was stored and the size the
 * two panes have to share (`containerPx` — primary plus secondary, so the
 * secondary simply takes the remainder).
 *
 * - No stored request (null, 0, NaN, a negative) means never dragged, and
 *   `defaultRatio` applies — so a bigger window opens with a proportionally
 *   bigger primary rather than a fixed one.
 * - Both floors are honoured, and THE SECONDARY'S FLOOR WINS over the primary's
 *   request: dragging one way can never push the other pane off the edge.
 * - When the container cannot hold both floors, the two shrink in proportion
 *   rather than one taking everything. Both panes stay on screen and scroll
 *   internally; the alternative is a pane of zero size, which is the
 *   invisible-content failure this function exists to prevent.
 * - An unmeasured container (0, NaN — the first frame, or jsdom) answers the
 *   primary's floor rather than 0, so a pane is never painted with no size.
 * - `maxPrimaryPx`, when set, caps the primary but never below its floor.
