// What the Skills window shows, decided here rather than inside the component.
//
// THE ROW IS A SKILL; THE AGENTS ARE CHIPS ON IT. The page has to answer "which
// agents can do what" at a glance, and one row per skill answers it in one
// glance — the same skill on three agents is one row with three chips, not
// three rows, and the list stays the length of the skill set rather than
// (agents x skills).
//
// Two different things share one list — skills, and skill LIBRARIES found on
// the backend host — so selection has to name which kind it is. Keying
// selection on a bare string would let a library called "research" and a skill
// called "research" select each other, which is the sort of bug that only shows
// up on somebody else's workspace.
