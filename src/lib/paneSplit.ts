// Where a draggable divider sits, for any two-pane split in the app.
//
// This is the shared clamp for the app's resizable dividers: browse lists,
// master/detail panes, the Agents grid/map split, and the applet editor/preview
// split. The part that is worth having exactly once is not the pointer plumbing
// — it is the CLAMP.
//
// A divider position is persisted, which is how it becomes a trap. A width
// chosen in a wide window and restored in a narrow one, or a height chosen in
// a tall window and restored in a short one, can leave a pane at zero size:
// content that is present, invisible, and says nothing about why. That is the
// same class of failure as the persisted owner-filter that hid every agent
// AND the control that cleared it (tests/smoke/README.md).
//
// So a stored number is never used as the layout. It is a REQUEST, and
// `clampPaneSplit` is the answer, recomputed from the live container size on
// every render. Because the clamp is DERIVED rather than written back,
// shrinking a window and growing it again returns the split the user actually
// chose, instead of quietly destroying it.
//
// Deliberately free of React and of any `window` reference, so the whole
// decision is testable by handing it two numbers.

 * The size the LEADING pane gets, in px, from what was stored and the size the

 * simply takes the remainder).
 *
 * - No stored request (null, 0, NaN, a negative) means never dragged, and the
 *   default ratio applies — so a bigger window opens with a proportionally
 *   bigger leading pane rather than a fixed one.
 * - Both floors are honoured, and THE TRAILING PANE'S FLOOR WINS over the
 *   leading pane's request: dragging outward can never push the other pane off
 *   the edge.
 * - When the container cannot hold both floors, the two shrink in proportion
 *   rather than one of them taking everything. Both panes stay on screen and
 *   scroll internally; the alternative is a pane of zero size, which is the
 *   invisible-content failure this function exists to prevent.
 * - An unmeasured container (0, NaN — the first frame, or jsdom) answers the
 *   leading floor rather than 0, so a pane is never painted with no size.
