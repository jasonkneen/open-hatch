// Owns the whole "what's new" update surface. Mount once, near the app root.
//
// Three triggers converge on one themed dialog:
//   1. deploy_published WS event — a new frontend published while this tab is
//      open (live sessions). Shows the "reload" toast → dialog.
//   2. cold-load version check — /version.json's buildId differs from the baked
//      BUILD_ID (e.g. an installed PWA reopened onto a stale cache). Same toast.
//   3. first load AFTER an update — we're running a build the user hasn't seen
//      notes for; shows the "what's new" recap dialog once, then records it.
//
// The reload path uses vite-plugin-pwa's `updateServiceWorker(true)` to activate
// the waiting service worker (skipWaiting) and swap in the new precache — a real
// cache bust — falling back to a hard reload where no SW is involved.
/**
 * `swOnly` registers the service worker and does nothing else — no version check,
 * no toast, no dialog.
 *
 * The logged-OUT mount needs the SW registration (a visitor who never signs in
 * would otherwise never register one, and an outdated SW serves the stale shell
 * forever with no update path). It must NOT run the rest: "You're on the latest
 * agensis, here's what changed" was appearing on the sign-in page, to someone who
 * has not signed in and has no idea what the product is.
