// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE HUDDLE, AS ONE PANEL.
//
// Rendered at App level, outside every window and every view, so it survives
// navigation — the whole reason the session was lifted into HuddleDockContext.
// It carries what used to be scattered across a header strip, a side panel and
// a toolbar: who is in the call, the in-call controls, captions, and the
// conversation itself.
//
// AND IT OWNS THE CALL. That is the part that shipped missing: the dock read
// the join token and used it as a boolean for visibility, so it rendered a
// panel around a WebRTC session that was never established. Nobody connected,
// including the local user, and the roster was empty in every huddle because
// presence is written when a browser confirms its own connection — which
// nothing did. <HuddleRoom> below is the fix, and it is mounted HERE rather
// than in a channel view precisely because this is the thing that survives
// navigation.
//
// It floats ABOVE the window layer and the dock (CHROME_DEPTH.huddlePanel) but
// BELOW modals: a dialog must still be able to open over a call, or a confirm
// raised from inside the huddle would be painted behind it.
//
// AGENTS IN THE HUDDLE are real LiveKit participants. The browser publishes
// the selected active agent as a reliable room signal; that worker owns the
// human audio input and publishes speech back into the room. Other agent tiles
// remain visible but stay silent until selected. Typed channel messages keep
// their existing @handle/composer dispatch path; they are not duplicated into
// the voice media plane.
