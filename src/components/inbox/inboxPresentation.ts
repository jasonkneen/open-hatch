// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Shared presentation constants for the inbox surface.
//
// The design rests on one idea: a row is three lines of text and a face, and
// nothing else. One 32px avatar column at a 10px gutter puts every line of
// every row on the SAME left edge (12 + 32 + 10 = 54px), and nothing else
// structural is drawn — no rules between rows, no gaps, no cards, no radii, no
// shadows. Separation is done with whitespace and a ~3% background wash.
//
// Colour is spent in exactly three places: the unread dot, the amber
// "needs your decision" label, and the red "run failed" label. Everything else
// is foreground/muted, so a full list stays calm and the two rows that are
// actually costing a human time are the only things that shout.
//
// TYPE SCALE — see TEXT_BODY / TEXT_META / TEXT_MICRO below. The one rule is
// that NOTHING here is sized in px.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// --- Type scale -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// The app sets `html { font-size: var(--agensis-ui-font-size, 16px) }` and
// exposes that as a user setting (Settings → Appearance, 12–18px). Every other
// surface is therefore sized in rem and grows with it: the sidebar's nav rows
// are `text-sm`, so is a chat message body (components/ui/message.tsx), so is
// the Activity detail.
//
// The inbox was the one surface written in absolute px (`text-[13px]` /
// `text-[11px]`). At the default 16px base that is a coincidental match —
// `text-sm` computes to 14px — so it looked right and nobody noticed. Turn
// the base up and it stops being a match: measured at an 17px base, the sidebar
// label renders 14.88px while the inbox row stayed frozen at 13.00px, which is
// what makes the inbox read as a shrunken secondary panel next to it.
//
// So these three are the whole scale, and they are the app's, not a new one:
//
//   TEXT_BODY   0.875rem  sender name, preview, detail body — the app's body size
//   TEXT_META   0.75rem   category line, timestamps, entity ids
//   TEXT_MICRO  0.65rem   uppercase section labels only
//
// body:meta is 7:6, the same step the sidebar uses between an agent's name and
// its handle — deliberate, not accidental, and it holds at every base size
// because all three are rem.

 * (a file path, a uuid, a stack frame, a URL) makes the whole column wider than
 * the pane it lives in. The viewport's own inline `overflow: hidden scroll` then
 * has no horizontal scrollbar to offer, so the excess is simply CLIPPED. Every
 * row in the list loses its right-hand side, mid-word, at once.
 *
 * Measured in the inbox list pane at a 700px window: viewport clientWidth 339px,
 * injected div width 575.34px — 236px of every row cut off.

 * Forcing that div back to `display: block` makes it fill the viewport instead
 * of shrink-wrapping the content, and the text wraps. The `!` is needed because
 * the `display: table` is an inline style. Same fix as the sidebar's list
