// Capturing long-running chat work as a task.
//
// The gap this closes: asking an agent to do something real in a channel or a
// DM produced no task. Assigning a task to an agent has always opened a chat
// (server/task-dispatch.cjs), but the far more common direction — someone types
// the request straight into the conversation — left the work visible only as a
// "Thinking …" bubble in one thread. Nothing in the task list, nothing on the
// agent's card, nothing to look at a day later.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS A TASK IS DECIDED BY BEHAVIOUR, NOT BY TEXT.
//
// This is the whole design and it is worth being explicit about, because the
// obvious alternative is wrong. Reading the message and guessing "is this a
// request or a remark" needs either a keyword list (which fires on "can you
// explain how X works" and misses "the deploy is red") or a model call on every
// single message in the workspace — latency and spend on the hot path, to
// answer a question the turn itself answers for free a minute later.
//
// So nothing is classified up front. A job that is STILL RUNNING after
// CAPTURE_AFTER_SECONDS is, definitionally, the long-running non-conversational
// work Jason described: a chat reply is a handful of seconds and a burst of
// tokens, while real work opens files, runs commands and takes minutes. The
// threshold is the classifier, it costs nothing, and it cannot be fooled by
// phrasing.
//
// The cost of that choice, stated plainly: a task appears about a minute after
// the work starts rather than instantly, and a genuinely long conversational
// answer is occasionally captured. Both are recoverable in one click. The
// reverse errors — a paid classifier on every message, or a task for every
// "thanks!" — are not.
//
// IDEMPOTENCY IS THE DATABASE'S JOB. The sweep runs every 30 seconds against
// jobs that stay running for many minutes, so it re-sees the same job perhaps
// forty times, and every Fly machine sweeps independently. `tasks.origin_job_id`
// carries a unique index and the insert is ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING; a duplicate
// is a no-op row count, not a second task. No application-level "does one exist
// already" check could survive two machines sweeping the same second.

// A conversational turn does not survive this. Deliberately well clear of a
// slow-but-ordinary reply (a daemon-backed agent thinking hard about a question
// can take 30-40s) so the common case is never captured.
